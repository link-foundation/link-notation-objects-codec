{"body":"```\nCircular references use special ref links: (ref obj_0)\n```\n\nNow I see in readme we add special marker/reference/keyword `ref`. And it is redundant.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst obj = {\n  \"self\": obj\n  \"other\": { \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2 }\n};\n```\n\nSelf reference should be translated as (or similar):\n\n```\n(obj: \n  (self obj)\n  (other (\n     (1 1)\n     (2 2)\n   ))\n)\n```\n\nto links notation\n\nHow to read links notation:\n\n```\n(self-reference: first-reference second-reference ...)\n```\n\nImplement new style in both JS and Python versions.","comments":[],"title":"Instead of `ref` reference/marker use built-in references in links notation"}
